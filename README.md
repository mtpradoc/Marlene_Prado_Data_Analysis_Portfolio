## 2. Key Projects

### Project 1: Bike Sales Visualization with Google Sheets
- **Overview**: This project analyzes bike sales data, focusing on customer demographics, commuting habits, and purchasing behaviors. The analysis was done using Google Sheets to clean and organize the data, create visualizations, and build an interactive dashboard.
- **Tools Used**: Google sheets, Pivot tables and Dashboards
- **Key Insights**: The dashboard allows stakeholders to quickly filter and analyze bike sales trends based on gender, age group, and marital status. This visualization improves decision-making for marketing and sales strategies.

### Project n: Global Video Game Sales Analysis
- **Overview**: This project analyzes global video game sales data from Kaggle, focusing on sales trends over time, by genre, and by platform. Using Tableau, I visualized key insights into the performance of different game genres and platforms across years.
- **Tools**: Tableau, Kaggle (CSV data), Data Visualization Techniques
- **Key Insights**: The project visualized global sales trends over time, with genres color-coded for easy comparison. Filters were applied to analyze sales for specific platforms, such as PlayStation 1-4, and genre-wise sales comparisons revealed the top-performing genres across different years. These visualizations were then combined into an interactive dashboard, allowing for dynamic exploration of sales data by year, genre, and platform.

### Project n: Global Video Game Sales - Year Bins and Sales Comparison
- **Overview**: In this project, I created bins for year ranges in the video game sales dataset to analyze sales trends over time. The focus was on categorizing years, performing quick table calculations for percent of total global sales, and comparing global sales with EU sales.
- **Tools**: Tableau, Data Binning, Calculations (Percent of Total, Custom Calculations)
- **Key Insights**:
    Year ranges were grouped into 5-year bins, transforming the numeric Year field into a categorical field.
    Excluded null data to focus on sales from 1990 to 2015.
    Created a quick table calculation to display the percentage of total global sales.
    Built custom calculations to compare global sales with EU sales, showcasing the difference between the two.

### Project n: 
- **Overview**: I have an excel in the demographics table with 10rows with columns employeeId, Nameof Employee, EmployeeAge, EmployeeGender. The table JobTitle, the employeeid, emloyeeName, jobTitle.. one of the rows is missing its employeeId with 11 rows. Salary table has EmployeeID and EmployeeSalary with only 7 rows. we are going to do the joins in tableau, if we understand it in sql it is almost the same in tableau. Ipload the excel in tableau. Tableau. in tableu we bring demographics and choose a join that we are going to use, we bring the jobtitle table .. it is giving a visualization of the types of visualizations. lets see each of the joins left, right, inner, and full outter. lets go inner join... then we see that only the items that match employeeid are brought but one of the while making employeeid is equal employeeid in both tables. we can do the right join, now we can see the all the info from job table. in the outter join using employeeid , it produces 2 rows. left join we can see demographics complete rows and jobtitle only the info that matches. Now we use employee name in both tables demographics and jobtable. Now we bring the demographics table joined with jobtitle and salary table( joined on employee_id). Demographics + joins demo. we have the dimensions and measures. for columns we ue name of employee and for rows sum(employee salary), mark color for sum of employee salary.

### Project 4: Employee Demographics and Salary Analysis with Joins

- **Overview**: This project demonstrates the use of joins in Tableau by combining multiple tables (Demographics, Job Title, and Salary) from an Excel file. The project focuses on understanding different types of joins—Inner, Left, Right, and Full Outer—and their impact on the dataset, mimicking SQL-like joins in Tableau to analyze employee demographics and salary data.

- **Tools Used**: Tableau, Excel

- **Key Insights**:
  - Explored different join types (Inner, Left, Right, and Full Outer) using the `EmployeeID` field.
  - Analyzed how different joins affect the resulting dataset, such as matching records and missing data.
  - Joined tables to consolidate employee demographics, job titles, and salaries into a single view.
  - Visualized the total salary per employee by creating a simple bar chart with `Employee Name` on columns and `Sum of Employee Salary` on rows, using colors to differentiate salary totals.
