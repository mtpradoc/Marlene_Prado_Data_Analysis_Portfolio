### Project n: Global Video Game Sales Analysis
- **Overview**: This project analyzes global video game sales data from Kaggle, focusing on sales trends over time, by genre, and by platform. Using Tableau, I visualized key insights into the performance of different game genres and platforms across years.
- **Tools**: Tableau, Kaggle (CSV data), Data Visualization Techniques
- **Key Insights**: The project visualized global sales trends over time, with genres color-coded for easy comparison. Filters were applied to analyze sales for specific platforms, such as PlayStation 1-4, and genre-wise sales comparisons revealed the top-performing genres across different years. These visualizations were then combined into an interactive dashboard, allowing for dynamic exploration of sales data by year, genre, and platform.

### Project n: Global Video Game Sales - Year Bins and Sales Comparison
- **Overview**: In this project, I created bins for year ranges in the video game sales dataset to analyze sales trends over time. The focus was on categorizing years, performing quick table calculations for percent of total global sales, and comparing global sales with EU sales.
- **Tools**: Tableau, Data Binning, Calculations (Percent of Total, Custom Calculations)
- **Key Insights**:
    Year ranges were grouped into 5-year bins, transforming the numeric Year field into a categorical field.
    Excluded null data to focus on sales from 1990 to 2015.
    Created a quick table calculation to display the percentage of total global sales.
    Built custom calculations to compare global sales with EU sales, showcasing the difference between the two.

### Project 4: Employee Demographics and Salary Analysis with Joins

- **Overview**: This project demonstrates the use of joins in Tableau by combining multiple tables (Demographics, Job Title, and Salary) from an Excel file. The project focuses on understanding different types of joins—Inner, Left, Right, and Full Outer—and their impact on the dataset, mimicking SQL-like joins in Tableau to analyze employee demographics and salary data.

- **Tools Used**: Tableau, Excel

- **Key Insights**:
  - Explored different join types (Inner, Left, Right, and Full Outer) using the `EmployeeID` field.
  - Analyzed how different joins affect the resulting dataset, such as matching records and missing data.
  - Joined tables to consolidate employee demographics, job titles, and salaries into a single view.
  - Visualized the total salary per employee by creating a simple bar chart with `Employee Name` on columns and `Sum of Employee Salary` on rows, using colors to differentiate salary totals.

### Project 5: Seattle Airbnb Data Analysis

- **Overview**: This project analyzes Airbnb listings in Seattle using data from 2016. The dataset includes listings, reviews, and calendar data. I performed several joins and created visualizations in Tableau to explore pricing, location, and trends that impact Airbnb profitability.

- **Tools Used**: Tableau, Excel (Airbnb Dataset)

- **Key Insights**:
  - **Price by Zipcode**: Analyzed the average price of Airbnb listings by zipcode to identify the most expensive areas. This helps determine where to buy property for Airbnb rentals.
  - **Price per Zipcode Map**: Created a map visualization showing average prices for each zipcode, colored and labeled to highlight areas with the highest rental prices.
  - **Revenue per Year**: Analyzed Airbnb revenue trends over the weeks of 2016 to determine the best time to list properties.
  - **Average Price per Bedroom**: Examined how the number of bedrooms affects price, showing that one-bedroom properties are performing well.
  - **Distinct Count of Bedroom Listings**: Filtered out null and zero-bedroom listings and counted distinct bedroom listings to assess property availability by size.
  
- **Visualizations**:
  1. **Price by Zipcode**: A bar chart showing average Airbnb prices across Seattle’s zip codes.
  2. **Price per Zipcode Map**: A map view of Seattle with zip codes colored by average price, helping to identify the most lucrative areas for Airbnb.
  3. **Revenue per Year**: A line chart of revenue trends across weeks in 2016, helping identify the best times to list properties.
  4. **Average Price per Bedroom**: A bar chart displaying average Airbnb prices based on the number of bedrooms.
  5. **Distinct Count of Bedroom Listings**: A count of Airbnb listings by the number of bedrooms.
